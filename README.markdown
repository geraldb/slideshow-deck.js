# deck.js - Slide Show (S9) Template Pack

## What's Slide Show (S9)?

A Ruby gem that lets you create slide shows and author slides in plain text
using a wiki-style markup language that's easy-to-write and easy-to-read.

## Intro

The [deck.js](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js) package
by Caleb Troughton (aka imakewebthings) bundled up into 
a Slide Show (S9) template pack lets you author your slides
in a wiki-style markup language (that is, Markdown or Textile) plus
lets you use text filters and helpers for adding comments, macros,
includes, syntax highlighters with http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter and much more.

Note, the deck.js template pack is configured to use
the following headers in `slides.html.erb`:

    author: Your Name Here
    title: Your Slide Show Title Here
 
## Try It Yourself - How To Use the deck.js Template Pack

If you want to try it yourself, install (fetch) the new template pack. Issue the command:

    $ slideshow -f deck.js

Or as an alternative clone the template pack using `git`. Issue the commands:

    $ cd ~/.slideshow/templates
    $ git clone git://github.com/geraldb/slideshow-deck.js.git

To check if the new template got installed, use the `-l/--list` switch/command:

    $ slideshow -l

Listing something like:

    Installed templates include:
       deck.js (~/.slideshow/templates/deck.js/deck.js.txt)

Tip: To get started use the included quick starter sample. Issue the command:

    $ slideshow -q deck.js

Now you will have a copy of the deck.js Quick Starter sample
(that is, [`deck.js.text`](https://raw.github.com/geraldb/slideshow-deck.js/master/sample.markdown))
in Markdown in your working folder.

## How to Make a Deck

1. ### Write Slides
   Slide content is simple HTML.
2. ### Choose Themes
   One for slide styles and one for deck transitions.
3. ### Include Extensions
   Add extra functionality to your deck, or leave it stripped down.


## The Markup

Slides are just HTML elements with a class of `slide`.

    <section class='slide'>
      <h2>How to Make a Deck</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Write Slides</h3>
          <p>Slide content is simple HTML.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Choose Themes</h3>
          <p>One for slide styles and one for deck transitions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Include Extensions</h3>
          <p>Add extra functionality to your deck, or leave it stripped down.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

## Digging Deeper

If you want to learn about making your own themes,
extending deck.js, and more, check out the
[documentation](http://imakewebthings.github.com/deck.js/docs).
```

Showtime! Let's use the `-t/--template` switch to generate the
sample slide show. Example:

    $ slideshow -t deck.js deck.js.text --h2

Note: Use the `--h2` option to break up slides on heading level 2
(the default is `--h1`, that is, heading level 1).

Open up the generated `deck.js.html` page in your browser. Voila. That's it.
